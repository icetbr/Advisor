A plugin for [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker), created by [djdookie](https://github.com/djdookie/Advisor), fixed by [kimsey0](https://github.com/kimsey0/Advisor), and now maintained by me.

It reads over a thousand decks from [hsreplay.net](https://hsreplay.net/) and guesses which one your opponent is playing. It starts assuming he is using the most popular deck, then after each played card it trys to guess again. Played cards are removed (or greyed out) from the archetype list.
